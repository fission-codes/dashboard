This is the dashboard that allows users and developers to manage their accounts and related platform components for Fission.

It goes alongside the rest of the Fission platform components, including:
* [fission](https://github.com/fission-suite/fission) - the server and CLI
* [auth-lobby](https://github.com/fission-suite/auth-lobby) - the authentication lobby that is used for users to give permission to apps

# QuickStart

# Table of Contents

# How To

## Build with [nix](https://github.com/NixOS/nix)

```sh
$ nix-shell
```

This will set you up with a shell that has all executable tools needed for development.

We recommend using [`lorri`](https://github.com/target/lorri) for something a better developer experience.

## Run

```
$ just install-deps
$ just
```

Now there is a development server running on http://localhost:8004. Open that link in your browser to see the running app.
