This is the dashboard that allows users and developers to manage their accounts and related platform components for Fission.

It goes alongside the rest of the Fission platform components, including:
* [fission](https://github.com/fission-suite/fission) - the server and CLI
* [auth-lobby](https://github.com/fission-suite/auth-lobby) - the authentication lobby that is used for users to give permission to apps
